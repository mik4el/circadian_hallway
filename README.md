# circadian_hallway
Control color and intensity of led strips in a hallway to match optimal human circadian rhythm. Arduino and python interface to custom electronics for 200W RGB leds.

# Suggested hardware
Raspi, Arduino Pro Micro (but it is a hazzle to program from commandline), RGB leds with common anode and transistors to control from Arduino.

# Todos
1. Take serial commands from python with color and animation time, animate to that color in the given time.
1. Python command that sets color for circadian rythm depending on time of day.
